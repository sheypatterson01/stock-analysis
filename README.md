# Stock-Analysis
## Prefeorming a detailed analysis on stock data to help determine the total daily volume and returns
### Overview of Project: 
The entire over-arching goal of this project, was to analyze stock data for the years 2017 and 2018. The goal of this specific challenge however, was to refactor the VBA code to both determine if the stock is worth investing in, and to run more efficiently.
### Results: 
 '1a) Create a ticker Index
        tickerIndex = 0

    '1b) Create three output arrays
        Dim tickerVolumes(12) As Long
        Dim tickerStartingPrices(12) As Single
        Dim tickerEndingPrices(12) As Single
        
    
    ''2a) Create a for loop to initialize the tickerVolumes to zero.
        For i = 0 To 11
            tickerVolumes(i) = 0
            tickerStartingPrices(i) = 0
            tickerEndingPrices(i) = 0
        Next i
        
        
    ''2b) Loop over all the rows in the spreadsheet.
        For i = 2 To RowCount
    
        '3a) Increase volume for current ticker
            tickerVolumes(tickerIndex) = tickerVolumes(tickerIndex) + Cells(i, 8).Value
        
        '3b) Check if the current row is the first row with the selected tickerIndex.
        'If  Then
        If Cells(i, 1).Value = tickers(tickerIndex) And Cells(i - 1, 1).Value <> tickers(tickerIndex) Then
            tickerStartingPrices(tickerIndex) = Cells(i, 6).Value
        End If
        
        'End If
        
        '3c) check if the current row is the last row with the selected ticker
         'If the next row’s ticker doesn’t match, increase the tickerIndex.
        'If  Then
            
        If Cells(i, 1).Value = tickers(tickerIndex) And Cells(i + 1, 1).Value <> tickers(tickerIndex) Then
            tickerEndingPrices(tickerIndex) = Cells(i, 6).Value
        End If

            '3d Increase the tickerIndex.
        If Cells(i, 1).Value = tickers(tickerIndex) And Cells(i + 1, 1).Value <> tickers(tickerIndex) Then
            tickerIndex = tickerIndex + 1
        End If
        
        'End If
    
    Next i
    
    '4) Loop through your arrays to output the Ticker, Total Daily Volume, and Return.
    For i = 0 To 11
        
        Worksheets("All Stocks Analysis").Activate
        Cells(4 + i, 1).Value = tickers(i)
        Cells(4 + i, 2).Value = tickerVolumes(i)
        Cells(4 + i, 3).Value = tickerEndingPrices(i) / tickerStartingPrices(i) - 1
        
    Next i

Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.
### Summary:
In a summary statement, address the following questions.
What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
